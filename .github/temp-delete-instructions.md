# Branch Cleanup Instructions

I've created the pull request #22 with the fix for issue #9 (making rule instances singletons to improve rule factory efficiency). 

## Branches to Delete

These branches appear to have been created for optimizations but do not contain the changes needed to fix issue #9:

1. `feature/optimize-context-analysis`
2. `feature/optimize-context-analysis-new`

The `feature/optimize-context-analysis` branch contains some valuable optimizations for the context analysis with:
- A new `getJoinedLinesAround()` method in the RuleContext interface
- XssPreventionRule implementation using this method for better performance

You can delete these branches using the GitHub interface (settings â†’ branches) or with Git:

```bash
# Delete branches locally
git branch -d feature/optimize-context-analysis
git branch -d feature/optimize-context-analysis-new

# Delete branches on the remote
git push origin --delete feature/optimize-context-analysis
git push origin --delete feature/optimize-context-analysis-new
```

## Recommendations

1. Review and merge PR #22 to implement rule caching as per issue #9
2. Consider creating a new PR later to incorporate the context analysis optimizations from the `feature/optimize-context-analysis` branch if those optimizations are valuable

Note: You can delete this file once you've completed the branch cleanup.
